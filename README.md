Salty Baseline
==============

Trying out some different approaches for using pillar and describing the core of a given machine.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but please don't run anything from this repo unless you are 100% sure it does what you want!

### Note
I'm actually using this stuff in production, but hosted in different repos. As a result, there might be some divergence or omissions. Please feel free to ask if something seems strange or doesn't work as expected!
